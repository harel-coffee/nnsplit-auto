# Controller

This folder contains `controller_nn.py` as the controller. This script reads the NN weights from the H5 file. The H5 file is produced using the trained model (Jupyter Notebooks, together with the weights from the bnn_weights folder). The `results` subfolder is used to contain the classification results.
